# Notes on Markdown Nest Constructor

## Finer granularity

After you get this thing really workng, you should consider making a more fne-grained version of it which operates at the sub-paragraph level. I.e. it would be able to put in sentences or even words inside paragraphs. Stay at the Markdown level rather than XML or .docx since that gets real hairy real fast.
