# Notes on Markdown Nest Constructor

## HTML wrapper

Use the HTML wrapper utility from PH, with a browser tab opening up, to view both source .md file(s) and build result file.

## Ignore empty lines

The code should ignore empty lines it encounters in source .md file(s). 

## Finer granularity

After you get this thing really workng, you should consider making a more fne-grained version of it which operates at the sub-paragraph level. I.e. it would be able to put in sentences or even words inside paragraphs. Stay at the Markdown level rather than XML or .docx since that gets real hairy real fast. This idea would be a second generation of the code, effectively a new function.
